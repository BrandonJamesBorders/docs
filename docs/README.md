# Welcome to the Craft Documentation

This page describes the first-party learning materials in the Craftsphere and splits off into documentation for [Craft CMS](/3.x/), [Craft Commerce](/commerce/3.x/), [Craft Nitro](/nitro/), and the [Intro to Craft CMS tutorial](/getting-started-tutorial/).

## Browse Product Documentation

The documentation is each product’s user manual, describing its features and how to work with it. It’s for front end developers building sites, and PHP developers extending Craft or Commerce.

<div class="w-full sm:flex sm:-mx-2">
    <LinkPanel title="Craft CMS" subtitle="Flexible content management." link="/3.x/" icon="/docs/icons/craft.svg" />
    <LinkPanel title="Craft Commerce" subtitle="Custom, extensible ecommerce." link="/commerce/3.x/" icon="/docs/icons/commerce.svg" />
</div>

The documentation is organized to be read sequentially, starting with installation and core concepts it continues to build on. It ends with _Extending_ sections to be used as jumping-off points adding to or enhancing Craft or Commerce with your own code. You can jump around however you’d like, but sometimes it helps to work your way down a section in order.

## Follow the Tutorial

The tutorial is the best place to start if you’re new to Craft. It doesn’t require development experience and explains how to get started with a code editor, local development environment, and Craft CMS installation to build a simple blog.

## Clone a Starter

There’s also a starter project with Twig and Gatsby examples if you’d rather spin up a site to investigate.

<div class="w-full sm:flex sm:-mx-2">
    <LinkPanel title="Blog Starter" subtitle="craftcms/starter-blog" link="https://github.com/craftcms/starter-blog" :repo="true" />
</div>

## Visit the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base lives at [craftcms.com/knowledge-base](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base).

Knowledge Base articles are more atomic, each one focusing on a topic that might augment the documentation or answer a common support question. While Knowledge Base articles share common categories and sometimes link to one another other, there’s no overarching structure like there is with the documentation.
